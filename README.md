Hi, In this project, I developed **GraphQL APIs** using JavaScript in **Spring Boot** to expose GraphQL APIs so that I can work more strategically than ever before. Learnt to build, maintain, and evolve robust GraphQL APIs with the full power of the Spring Framework, exploring the basics as well as more advanced topics like **mutations**, **batching**, **telemetry**, **error handling**, **extending an API**, and more.
